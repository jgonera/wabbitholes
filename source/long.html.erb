- title: Earth
  extract: |-
    Earth, also known as the world, Terra, or Gaia, is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets, and the only celestial body known to accommodate life. It is home to millions of species, including billions of humans who depend upon its biosphere and minerals. The Earth's human population is divided among about two hundred independent states that interact through diplomacy, conflict, travel, trade, and media.
    According to evidence from sources such as radiometric dating, Earth was formed around four and a half billion years ago. Within its first billion years, life appeared in its oceans and began to affect its atmosphere and surface, promoting the proliferation of aerobic as well as anaerobic organisms and causing the formation of the atmosphere's ozone layer. This layer and Earth's magnetic field block the most life-threatening parts of the Sun's radiation, so life was able to flourish on land as well as in water. Since then, Earth's position in the Solar System, its physical properties and its geological history have allowed life to persist.
    Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid segments, or tectonic plates, that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. Over 70% percent of Earth's surface is covered with water, with the remainder consisting of continents and islands which together have many lakes and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. Earth's poles are mostly covered with ice that is the solid ice of the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice that is the polar ice packs.

- title: Human
  extract: |-
    Modern humans (Homo sapiens or Homo sapiens sapiens) are the only extant members of the hominin clade, a branch of great apes characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies. Early hominids, such as the australopithecines who had more apelike brains and skulls, are less often thought of or referred to as "human" than hominids of the genus Homo some of whom used fire, occupied much of Eurasia, and gave rise to  anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 200,000 years ago where they began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago and migrated out in successive waves to occupy all but the smallest, driest, and coldest lands. In the last 100 years, this has extended to permanently manned bases in Antarctica, on offshore platforms, and orbiting the Earth. The spread of humans and their large and increasing population has had a destructive impact on large areas of the environment and millions of native species worldwide. Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, which enable high levels of abstract reasoning, language, problem solving, sociality, and culture through social learning. Humans use tools to a much higher degree than any other animal, are the only extant species known to build fires and cook their food, as well as the only extant species to clothe themselves and create and use numerous other technologies and arts.
    Humans are uniquely adept at utilizing systems of symbolic communication such as language and art for self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and organization. Humans create complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to states. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values, social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human society. The human desire to understand and influence their environment, and explain and manipulate phenomena, has been the foundation for the development of science, philosophy, mythology, and religion.

- title: Hominini
  extract: |-
    The Hominini are a tribe of Homininae comprising the genus Homo and other genera of the human clade after the split from the tribe Panini (chimpanzees). Members of the tribe are called hominins (cf Hominidae, "hominids"). The subtribe Hominina is the "human" branch, including genus Homo. Researchers proposed the taxon Hominini on the basis of the idea that the least similar species of a trichotomy should be separated from the other two. Some earlier classification schemes include the genus Pan (chimpanzees) within the Hominini, but this classification is now rarely followed. Sahelanthropus tchadensis is an extinct hominid species that lived 7 million years ago, very close to the time of the chimpanzee / human divergence; it is thus unclear whether it can be considered a member of the Hominini tribe.
    Through DNA comparison, scientists believe the Pan / Homo divergence occurred between 5.4 and 6.3 million years ago, after an unusual process of speciation that ranged over 4 million years. Few fossil specimens on the Pan side of the split have been found, the first fossil chimpanzee discovery being published in 2005, dating to between 545 ± 3 kyr (thousand years) and 284 ± 12 kyr via Argon-argon dating, from Kenya's East African Rift Valley. All of the extinct genera listed in the table to the right are ancestral to Homo, or are offshoots of such. However, both Orrorin and Sahelanthropus existed around the time of the split, and so may be ancestral to all three extant species.

- title: Tribe (biology)
  extract: |-
    In biology, a tribe is a taxonomic rank between family and genus. It lies below ranks with names derived from family, such as subfamily. It is sometimes subdivided into subtribes.
    In zoology, some examples include the tribes Caprini (goat-antelopes), Hominini (hominins), Bombini (bumblebees), and Thunnini (tunas). The standard ending for the name of a zoological tribe is "-ini". The tribe Hominini is divided into subtribes by some scientists; subtribe Hominina then comprises "humans". The standard ending for the name of a zoological subtribe is "-ina".
    In botany, examples include the tribes Acalypheae and Hyacintheae. The standard ending for the name of a botanical tribe is "-eae". The tribe Hyacintheae is divided into subtribes, including the subtribe Massoniinae.

- title: Biology
  extract: Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living
    organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution,
    and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches
    and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain
    general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating
    it into single, coherent fields. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the
    basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the
    engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood
    today that all organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating
    their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition.

- title: Natural science
  extract: |-
    Natural sciences are the empirical sciences endeavoring to explain or predict nature's phenomena. (Other empirical sciences—cognitive sciences like artificial intelligence, behavioral sciences like psychology, and social sciences like economics—more directly focus on human and, in similitude, robotic functions and experiences.) There are five branches of natural science: astronomy, biology, chemistry, the Earth sciences and physics. Each domain collaborates experimental/observational and theoretical/mathematical divisions.
    Via Western society's analytic tradition, the empirical and especially natural sciences heavily borrow tools from formal sciences, such as mathematics and logic—which concern abstract truths via relations among ideas—while history and humanities in turn borrow methods from empirical and even natural sciences. Yet empirical sciences relying more on qualitative research, such as social sciences, are sometimes called "soft science", whereas natural sciences, insofar as emphasizing quantifiable data produced, tested, and confirmed via scientific method are sometimes called "hard science".
    Usually traced, especially via Aristotle, to ancient Greece, natural science succeeds natural philosophy, which Galileo gave an experimental turn, Descartes gave a mechanical turn, and Newton gave a mathematical turn. Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain requisite in natural science. Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeed natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.

- title: Science
  extract: |-
    Science (from Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. In an older and closely related meaning, "science" also refers to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. A practitioner of science is known as a scientist.
    Since classical antiquity, science as a type of knowledge has been closely linked to philosophy. During the Islamic Golden Age, foundation for scientific method was laid which emphasized on experimental data and reproducibility of its results. In the early modern period the words "science" and "philosophy of nature" were sometimes used interchangeably. By the 17th century, natural philosophy (which is today called "natural science") was considered a separate branch of philosophy.
    In modern usage, "science" most often refers to a way of pursuing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. It is also often restricted to those branches of study that seek to explain the phenomena of the material universe. In the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature such as Newton's laws of motion.

- title: Knowledge
  extract: Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something,
    such as facts, information, descriptions, or skills, which is acquired through
    experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning. Knowledge can
    refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit
    (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding
    of a subject); it can be more or less formal or systematic. In philosophy, the
    study of knowledge is called epistemology; the philosopher Plato famously defined
    knowledge as "justified true belief", though "well-justified true belief" is more
    complete as it accounts for the Gettier problems. However, several definitions
    of knowledge and theories to explain it exist.

- title: Fact
  extract: A fact (derived from the Latin factum, see below) is something that has
    really occurred or is actually the case. The usual test for a statement of fact
    is verifiability, that is, whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience.
    Standard reference works are often used to check facts.

- title: Experience
  extract: |-
    Experience consists of knowledge of or skill of some thing or some event gained through involvement in or exposure to that thing or event. The history of the word experience aligns it closely with the concept of experiment. For example, the word experience could be used in a statement like: "I have experience in fishing".
    The concept of experience generally refers to know-how or procedural knowledge, rather than propositional knowledge: on-the-job training rather than book-learning. Philosophers dub knowledge based on experience "empirical knowledge" or "a posteriori knowledge".
    The interrogation of experience has a long tradition in continental philosophy. Experience plays an important role in the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard. The German term Erfahrung, often translated into English as "experience", has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of life's experiences.
    A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an expert.
    Certain religious traditions (such as types of Buddhism, Surat Shabd Yoga, mysticism and Pentecostalism) and educational paradigms with, for example, the conditioning of military recruit-training (also known as "boot camps"), stress the experiential nature of human epistemology.

- title: Experiment
  extract: |-
    An experiment is an orderly procedure carried out with the goal of verifying, refuting, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis. Controlled experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Controlled experiments vary greatly in their goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exist natural experimental studies.
    A child may carry out basic experiments to understand the nature of gravity, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to advance the understanding of a phenomenon. Experiments can vary from personal and informal natural comparisons (e.g. tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite), to highly controlled (e.g. tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists that hope to discover information about subatomic particles).
