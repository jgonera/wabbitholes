- title: St. Elsewhere
  extract: St. Elsewhere is an American medical drama television series that originally
    ran on NBC from October 26, 1982, to May 25, 1988. The series starred Ed Flanders,
    Norman Lloyd and William Daniels as teaching doctors at an aging, underrated Boston
    hospital who gave interns a promising future in making critical medical and life
    decisions. The series was produced by MTM Enterprises, which had success with
    a similar NBC series, the police drama Hill Street Blues, during that same time;
    both series were often compared to each other for their use of ensemble casts
    and overlapping serialized storylines (an original ad for St Elsewhere quoted
    a critic that called the series "'Hill Street Blues' in a hospital").
