- title: Earth
  extract: Earth, also known as the world, Terra, or Gaia, is the third planet from
    the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's
    four terrestrial planets, and the only celestial body known to accommodate life.
    It is home to millions of species, including billions of humans who depend upon
    its biosphere and minerals. The Earth's human population is divided among about
    two hundred independent states that interact through diplomacy, conflict, travel,
    trade, and media.

- title: Human
  extract: Modern humans (Homo sapiens or Homo sapiens sapiens) are the only extant
    members of the hominin clade, a branch of great apes characterized by erect posture
    and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use; and a general
    trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies. Early hominids, such as
    the australopithecines who had more apelike brains and skulls, are less often
    thought of or referred to as "human" than hominids of the genus Homo some of whom
    used fire, occupied much of Eurasia, and gave rise to  anatomically modern Homo
    sapiens in Africa about 200,000 years ago where they began to exhibit evidence
    of behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago and migrated out in successive
    waves to occupy all but the smallest, driest, and coldest lands. In the last 100
    years, this has extended to permanently manned bases in Antarctica, on offshore
    platforms, and orbiting the Earth.

- title: Hominini
  extract: The Hominini are a tribe of Homininae comprising the genus Homo and other
    genera of the human clade after the split from the tribe Panini (chimpanzees).
    Members of the tribe are called hominins (cf Hominidae, "hominids"). The subtribe
    Hominina is the "human" branch, including genus Homo.

- title: Biology
  extract: Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living
    organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution,
    and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches
    and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain
    general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating
    it into single, coherent fields.

- title: Natural science
  extract: 'Natural sciences are the empirical sciences endeavoring to explain or
    predict nature''s phenomena. (Other empirical sciences—cognitive sciences like
    artificial intelligence, behavioral sciences like psychology, and social sciences
    like economics—more directly focus on human and, in similitude, robotic functions
    and experiences.) There are five branches of natural science: astronomy, biology,
    chemistry, the Earth sciences and physics. Each domain collaborates experimental/observational
    and theoretical/mathematical divisions.'

- title: Science
  extract: Science (from Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge") is a systematic enterprise
    that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions
    about the universe. In an older and closely related meaning, "science" also refers
    to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and
    reliably applied. A practitioner of science is known as a scientist.

- title: Knowledge
  extract: Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something,
    such as facts, information, descriptions, or skills, which is acquired through
    experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning. Knowledge can
    refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit
    (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding
    of a subject); it can be more or less formal or systematic.

- title: Fact
  extract: A fact (derived from the Latin factum, see below) is something that has
    really occurred or is actually the case. The usual test for a statement of fact
    is verifiability, that is, whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience.
    Standard reference works are often used to check facts.

- title: Experience
  extract: 'Experience consists of knowledge of or skill of some thing or some event
    gained through involvement in or exposure to that thing or event. The history
    of the word experience aligns it closely with the concept of experiment. For example,
    the word experience could be used in a statement like: "I have experience in fishing".'

- title: Experiment
  extract: An experiment is an orderly procedure carried out with the goal of verifying,
    refuting, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis. Controlled experiments
    provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when
    a particular factor is manipulated. Controlled experiments vary greatly in their
    goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of
    the results.
