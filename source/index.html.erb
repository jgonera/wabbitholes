- title: Pacific Ocean
  extract: |-
    The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.
    At 165.25 million square kilometers (63.8 million square miles) in area, this largest division of the World Ocean – and, in turn, the hydrosphere – covers about 46% of the Earth's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area, making it larger than all of the Earth's land area combined.

- title: Challenger Deep
  extract: The Challenger Deep is the deepest known point in the Earth's seabed hydrosphere,
    with a depth of 10,898 to 10,916 m (35,755 to 35,814 ft) by direct measurement
    from submersibles, and slightly more by sonar bathymetry (see below). It is in
    the Pacific Ocean, at the southern end of the Mariana Trench near the Mariana
    Islands group. The Challenger Deep is a relatively small slot-shaped depression
    in the bottom of a considerably larger crescent-shaped oceanic trench, which itself
    is an unusually deep feature in the ocean floor.
